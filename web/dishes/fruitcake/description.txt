At some point in history, fruitcake was a display for prosperity. Dried fruits and nuts were expensive items and so people served this cake at special events - like Christmas - to, for lack of a better way to say it, show off.
Even though fruitcakes are no longer a way to display wealth, giving them is a tradition that has just stuck.
